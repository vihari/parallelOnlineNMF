mat <-Read the matrix
read the r option
analyze r,d,n values exit if there is error.
F<-allocate
G<-allocate
//The notation we consider here is X=F*transpose(G)
//gi is the ith column of transpose(G)
Initialize F and G with non negative values.

Repeat until all the data is used up.
1) get a row of data X
2) solve for gi;
3) Update F

Explanation of 2):
gi is the solution of the nls problem
minimization of ||x-Fg||**2
with F regarded as constant and parameters g
by minimizing frobenious loss.
constraints:
gi should be non-negative and
sum of all elements in gi should add up to 1.

Explanation of 3):
update g(t) from F(t-1)
Consider the whole of the data so far to 
update F.
minimize the frobenious loss for whole of 
the data and g(t) available.
Convex optimization can help but, may be 
computationally costly.
So consider second order Projected Gradient descent(PGD)
The equations are a bit too complex, that I have to change 
the encoding of the file or write it in too naive way.
