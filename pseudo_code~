mat <-Read the matrix
read the r option
analyze r,d,n values exit if there is error.
F<-allocate
G<-allocate
//The notation we consider here is X=F*transpose(G)
//gi is the ith column of transpose(G)
Initialize F and G with non negative values.

Repeat until all the data is used up.
1) get a row of data X
2) solve for gi;
3) Update F

Explanation of 2):
gi is the solution of the nls problem
by minimizing frobenious loss.
constraints:
gi should be non-negative and
sum of all elements in gi should add up to 1.

Explanation of 3):
